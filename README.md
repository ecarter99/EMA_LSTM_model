# EMA_LSTM_model

## Description
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of neural network designed for sequential data like time series, speech, and text. It's capable of selectively retaining and forgetting information from past inputs, allowing it to learn patterns and make predictions over long time horizons. The following LSTM has been tuned to predict whether or not a participant of the EMA study will be suicidal on a given day.
